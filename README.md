# Story
For the final project in the AR/VR specialization at Holberton School we had the freedom to create any type of AR/VR game we wanted. I decided that I wanted to create a game that incorporated a full VR body, a movement mechanic that feels good while standing still, all with multiplayer support. Many VR games use floating hand models, which does a pretty good job of giving you a presence in the virtual world, but is significantly less immersive than having a full body. I was able to acheive this by using Unitys Inverse Kinematics system and the Animation Rigging package. To solve the VR movement problem I created a grappling gun, allowing the player to quickly and easily move around the map in a way that makes sense while standing still in real life. For the multiplayer implementation I used the Photon Bolt engine.
